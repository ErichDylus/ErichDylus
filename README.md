I'm an attorney barred in DC and MD, contributor to API3 DAO, legal Îžngineer with LexDAO, and Solidity coder

Please read my [autonomous attorney disclosure](https://github.com/ErichDylus/Open-Source-Law/blob/main/Disclosure.md); I like [open-sourced law](https://github.com/ErichDylus/Open-Source-Law/tree/main/forms) and [free resources on smart contract development](https://github.com/ErichDylus/Smart-Contract-Resources/blob/master/Build.md)
